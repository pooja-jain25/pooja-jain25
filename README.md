Technical Projects I've Completed:

**2048** <br>
Implemented a Java-based recreation of the 2048 game, building a grid system to handle tile movements, merging, and number doubling mechanics. Developed logic to control gameplay, including valid moves and automatic tile spawning after each action. The project also included edge cases to prevent invalid moves and efficiently manage the game state. All operations were thoroughly tested using JUnit to ensure the game’s functionality and stability.

**NGrams** <br>
Implemented generic graph traversal algorithms, including BFS, DFS, and A* search, in Java to solve pathfinding problems in mazes. The project involved designing a search system that efficiently finds the shortest path through various maze configurations by incorporating heuristics for A* and managing the explored nodes using priority queues. Performance was optimized to handle different maze sizes, and extensive testing was done using JUnit to ensure the correctness of the algorithms.

**Personal Project: California K-12 Educational Equity Neural Network** <br>
Modeled Californian students’ graduation outcomes with 80% accuracy to assess and ensure fairness in minority communities. Utilized Folium to map student’s expulsion rates by county, highlighting a 63% higher rate among BIPOC populations. Advocated for targeted policy changes, proposing initiatives like incentivizing regular attendance to improve graduation rates

**Intelligent Pac-Man** <br>
Built (BFS, DFS, cost function, and A*) search algorithms, (Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, & Expectimax) decision-making algorithms, localization, mapping, SLAM using a SAT solver, inference, Q-learning, and other algorithms for Pac-Man in the CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course.

**Spam/Ham Mail Analysis** <br>
Built a logistic regression model for spam/ham email classification by engineering features such as word frequency and character patterns from real-world email data. Applied cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance and minimize overfitting, using the sklearn library for data preprocessing, model fitting, and generating ROC curves for assessing trade-offs between false positives and false negatives.

**Cook County Housing Analysis** <br>
Analyzed housing dataset in Cook County, Illinois for Data Science course. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis to understand data and inform modeling decisions. Implemented a data processing pipeline using pandas, and built a linear model with scikit-learn to predict housing prices using feature engineering. 

**CS61B, The Game** <br>
Built an engine that develops a pseudorandom explorable 2D tile-based map for the CS61B course.
